# Arithmetic operation in vector
# Arithmetic operations occur element wise in vector as i like a matrix operation

# Example

height_in <- c(69,62,66,70,70,73,67,73)
# if we had to convert in Cm

height_cm <- height_in*2.54
height_cm


City <- c(a,b,c,d,e,f)
Temp <- c(35,88,42,84,81,30)
city_temp <- data.frame(Name = City, Temperature = Temp)

# conversion in celcius

temp_Celcius <- (Temp-32)*5/9
temp_Celcius
